Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used in computer science and programming. They consist of a sequence of elements called nodes, where each node contains two parts: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations.
