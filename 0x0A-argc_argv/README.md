C - argc, argv
Arguments to main provide a useful opportunity to give parameters to programs. Typically, this facility is used to direct the way the program goes about its task. It's particularly common to provide file names to a program through its arguments.

In the context of programming, argc and argv are common terms used in C and C++ programming languages, specifically in the main function. They are used to handle command-line arguments passed to a program when it is executed.

argc stands for "argument count" and represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program. It is an integer value.

argv stands for "argument vector" and is an array of strings that holds the actual command-line arguments. Each element of the array (argv[0], argv[1], argv[2], and so on) contains a string representing one of the arguments.
