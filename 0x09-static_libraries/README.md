C - Static libraries
A static library, also known as a static link library or archive, is a collection of compiled object files that are combined into a single file. It contains pre-compiled functions, classes, or resources that can be linked with your program during the compilation process. When you create a static library, the code and data within it become part of your executable file, resulting in a standalone binary that doesn't require any external dependencies at runtime.

Static libraries offer the advantage of simplicity and ease of distribution since all the required code is packaged directly into the executable file. However, it also means that if you make changes to the library, you need to recompile and relink your program to incorporate those changes.
